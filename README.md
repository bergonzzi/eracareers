## Eracareers
This project is a lightweight alternative version of [eracareers.pt](http://www.eracareers.pt), or more specifically the ["research opportunity" search section](http://www.eracareers.pt/Search/index.aspx?task=search). A friend of mine was frustrated with it and asked if I could do something about it. So I did.

The original [eracareers.pt](http://www.eracareers.pt) is "co-funded by the European Commission and maintained by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology". Although it's supposed to be replaced with a better version as [mentioned here](http://www.euraxess.pt), it seems to be taking a while.

The project consists of 3 main components:
* A scraper to get all the data - [Scrapy](http://scrapy.org/)
* A search engine to search all the data - [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/)
* A frontend to present all the data - [Python](https://www.python.org/) + [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)

Note: this is still work in progress!

## Installation

* Clone this repo
* Install Scrapy 1.0 - check their [excellent documentation](http://scrapy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) to see how
* Install Elasticsearch - [download here](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch)
* Install Flask and pyes - use `pip install flask` and `pip install pyes`
* Provide a file with proxies named `proxies.txt` in `era_scraper/eracareers/middlewares` (or disable the 2 proxy middlewares in `era_scraper/eracareers/settings.py` if you don't have one)

## Usage

* Start up your elasticsearch instance
* Run the scraper to get the latest data - in the folder `era_scraper` do `scrapy crawl era`
* Start up the app - in the folder `era_search` do `python run.py`

This is enough to get it up and running locally (it's using Flask's development server). For a more robust installation you should probably run the app behind a webserver like nginx.
